    `Yesterday, we bumped into Laura. It had to happen, but you can\'t deny the timing couldn\'t be worse. The "mission" to try and seduce her was a complete failure last month. By the way, she still has the ring I gave her. Anyhow, it hasn\'t been a pleasurable experience to go through it. I wanted to feel done with it first. Actually, forget I said that. It was probably for the best - staying on this forever wasn\'t going lead anywhere good. I mean, I should not hold on to it forever. For what it\'s worth, I\'m glad it forced me to get out of this dreamy illusion. A lesson for further down the road. A sort of instructions manual for life is what these past weeks have been, and it was all thanks to her.`
